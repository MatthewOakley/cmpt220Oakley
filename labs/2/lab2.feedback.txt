Matthew, 

About your programs...

Functionality

- Could not test functionality because programs cannot be compiled. -1pt

Please make sure you read the problems well; follow instructions.


Style Check

- All programs have good style. However, when you break a line into two
  segments into a new line you must use double indentation. Ask me in class.

Please make sure you follow the style guidelines and that your programs can be
compiled using javac. Penalties will be higher as the semester moves forward.

Peace,

- Dr. Rivas
